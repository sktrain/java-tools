This is a very simple Jakarta EE application with REST-Frontend generated by the official Archetype
"Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE" (org.eclipse.starter:jakarta-starter) 
and customized for deployment against JBoss Wildfly.

You can use it as a template for your projects.


(Wildfly 32 is Jakarta EE10 and Java 17 compatibel)

If Wildfly-Server is running and JBOSS_HOME-Variable is set, you can deploy/undeploy based on
Wildfly-Plugin.

deploy:
Maven Goal "clean package wildfly:deploy"

undeploy:
Maven Goal "wildfly:undeploy"


The Application is available at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world/
The REST end-point is available at rest/hello. 
You can supply a name to the end-point using a query parameter like this: rest/hello?name=Jane




==========================

DataSource:
This sample includes a "persistence.xml" file in "src/main/resources/META-INF". This file defines
a persistence unit "maven_wildfly_ee8PersistenceUnit" which uses the JakartaEE default database.

In production environment, you should define a database in WildFly config and point to this database
in "persistence.xml".

If you don't use JPA, you can delete "persistence.xml".
==========================

CDI:
The web application is prepared for CDI 2.0 by bundling an "beans.xml" in "src/main/webapp/WEB-INF".
